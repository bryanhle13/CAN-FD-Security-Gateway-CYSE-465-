# CAN-FD-Security-Gateway-CYSE-465-

The document "can-fd demo.py" is the code that my partner and I wrote for a virtual CAN bus simulation where a receiver thread listens for messages while the main program sends two CAN frames. It shows how CAN nodes communicate by sending and receiving raw data bytes without any actual hardware.

The "requirements.txt" file tells Python which packages the code needs.
